# Architecture

GitHub Repo Auditor is a Python CLI tool that audits a GitHub user's entire repository portfolio. It fetches repo metadata from the GitHub REST API, shallow-clones each repo, runs 12 analysis dimensions over the local files, scores them on a dual-axis model (completeness + interest), and writes structured output in JSON, Markdown, Excel, and HTML formats.

## Typical Invocation

```bash
# Audit all public repos for a user
python3 -m src.cli saagpatel

# Audit with private repos and Notion sync
python3 -m src.cli saagpatel --token $GITHUB_TOKEN --notion

# Incremental re-audit of recently-changed repos only
python3 -m src.cli saagpatel --incremental

# Audit two specific repos with AI narrative
python3 -m src.cli saagpatel --repos my-app,my-lib --ai-narrative
```

## Analyzer Pipeline

### Entry Point

`run_all_analyzers()` in `src/analyzers/__init__.py` iterates over the `ALL_ANALYZERS` list and calls each analyzer's `analyze()` method:

```python
def run_all_analyzers(
    repo_path: Path,
    metadata: RepoMetadata,
    github_client: GitHubClient | None = None,
) -> list[AnalyzerResult]:
```

If an analyzer raises an exception it is caught, logged at `WARNING` level, and a zero-score `AnalyzerResult` with a `"Analysis failed: {error}"` finding is substituted. This ensures a single malformed repo never aborts the full portfolio audit.

### BaseAnalyzer Interface

Every analyzer extends `src/analyzers/base.py::BaseAnalyzer`:

```python
class BaseAnalyzer(ABC):
    name: str    # dimension key, e.g. "readme"
    weight: float

    @abstractmethod
    def analyze(
        self,
        repo_path: Path,
        metadata: RepoMetadata,
        github_client: GitHubClient | None = None,
    ) -> AnalyzerResult: ...

    def _result(self, score: float, findings: list[str], details: dict | None = None) -> AnalyzerResult:
        """Clamps score to [0.0, 1.0] and wraps in AnalyzerResult."""
```

Analyzers that need live GitHub API data (e.g., `ActivityAnalyzer` for commit frequency) accept the optional `github_client` parameter. File-only analyzers ignore it.

### The 12 Analyzers

| Dimension | Module | What it measures |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| `readme` | `readme.py` | Presence, description length, install/usage sections, code examples, badges |
| `structure` | `structure.py` | `.gitignore`, `src/` or language-standard layout, config file, LICENSE, directory depth |
| `code_quality` | `code_quality.py` | Entry point, TODO/FIXME density, type definitions, vendored files, commit message quality |
| `testing` | `testing.py` | Test directories/files, framework config, test file count |
| `cicd` | `cicd.py` | `.github/workflows/`, alternative CI configs, Makefile/build scripts |
| `dependencies` | `dependencies.py` | Lockfile presence, dependency manifest, dep count reasonableness |
| `activity` | `activity.py` | Recency of last push, total commit count, commit activity last 3 months, archived flag |
| `documentation` | `completeness.py` | `docs/` directory, CHANGELOG, CONTRIBUTING, inline comment density |
| `build_readiness` | `completeness.py` | Dockerfile, Makefile, `.env.example`, deployment config files |
| `community_profile` | `community_profile.py` | LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING, issue/PR templates, code of conduct |
| `interest` | `interest.py` | Tech novelty, project ambition signals, commit burst activity, stars/forks |
| `security` | `security.py` | Hardcoded secrets patterns, exposed `.env` files, overly-permissive configs |

---

## Scoring Model

### Completeness Score

`src/scorer.py::score_repo()` computes a weighted average of the 10 completeness dimensions (all except `interest` and `security`):

```python
WEIGHTS: dict[str, float] = {
    "readme": 0.12,
    "structure": 0.10,
    "code_quality": 0.15,
    "testing": 0.18,
    "cicd": 0.10,
    "dependencies": 0.08,
    "activity": 0.15,
    "documentation": 0.02,
    "build_readiness": 0.07,
    "community_profile": 0.03,
}
```

Testing and code quality carry the most weight (0.18 and 0.15). Documentation and community profile are intentionally light (0.02 and 0.03) to avoid penalising exploratory projects.

**Fork override:** For forked repos, the `activity` weight is reduced to `0.05` and the saved weight redistributed proportionally across remaining dimensions. Forks rarely have independent commit history so raw activity is not a meaningful signal.

### Interest Score

`InterestAnalyzer` produces an independent score on the same 0.0–1.0 scale, covering tech novelty, project ambition signals (domain complexity, unusual languages), and burst commit activity. It is not mixed into the completeness score — both axes appear side-by-side in reports.

A portfolio-relative novelty adjustment reduces the interest score for languages the user already uses heavily (≥30% of their portfolio), so the 15th Python CLI project scores lower for novelty than the first Zig project.

### Letter Grades

```
A  ≥ 0.80
B  ≥ 0.70
C  ≥ 0.55
D  ≥ 0.35
F  < 0.35
```

Both the completeness score and the interest score receive independent letter grades.

### Completeness Tiers

| Tier | Score Range | Meaning |
|------|-------------|---------|
| shipped | ≥ 0.75 | Production-ready or clearly complete |
| functional | 0.55 – 0.74 | Works, but missing tests or CI |
| wip | 0.35 – 0.54 | Active development, partially built |
| skeleton | 0.15 – 0.34 | Scaffolded, barely started |
| abandoned | < 0.15 | No meaningful content or no recent activity |

**Override rules:**
- Archived repos with score > 0.50 are capped at `functional`.
- Repos with last push > 2 years ago are capped at `wip` and flagged `stale-2yr`.
- Repos with no meaningful files beyond a README are forced to `skeleton` and flagged `readme-only`.

### Portfolio Health Grade

`compute_portfolio_grade()` adjusts the raw average score with bonuses and penalties:

- **Language diversity bonus:** up to +0.10 for portfolios spanning 4+ languages.
- **Shipped ratio bonus:** +0.05 or +0.10 when > 30% or > 50% of repos are `shipped`.
- **Abandonment penalty:** -0.05 or -0.10 when > 40% or > 60% of repos are `skeleton`/`abandoned`.
- **Badge density bonus:** +0.05 when average badges per repo > 3.

## Output Formats

### JSON Report

`output/audit-report-{username}-{date}.json` — full `AuditReport` serialized via `.to_dict()`. Contains all `RepoAudit` objects with per-dimension scores, findings, details, flags, badges, and both axis grades. Machine-readable; used by external tools and PCC import.

### Markdown Report

`output/audit-report-{username}-{date}.md` — human-readable summary with:
- Portfolio summary table: total repos, tier distribution, average scores, portfolio grade.
- Tier-grouped sections (shipped → abandoned) with score, grade, and flags per repo.
- Per-repo detail blocks with dimension breakdown and key findings.
- Registry reconciliation section (if `--registry` flag used).
- Action items: highest-leverage improvement suggestions across the portfolio.

### Excel Dashboard

`output/dashboard-{username}-{date}.xlsx` — workbook generated by `src/excel_export.py`.

The workbook now has two modes:
- `template` (default): hydrates the committed workbook template and preserves template-owned workbook structure.
- `standard`: fallback fully code-generated workbook path for CI/debugging.

Important workbook facts:
- Hidden `Data_*` sheets remain the source of truth.
- New workbook contract tables include `tblTrendMatrix`, `tblPortfolioHistory`, `tblRollups`, and `tblReviewTargets`.
- Operator KPI bindings are exposed via workbook named ranges rather than workbook-only calculations.
- Workbook ranking and trend views must always derive from the full filtered portfolio baseline, even during targeted or incremental reruns.

### HTML Dashboard

`output/dashboard-{username}-{date}.html` — self-contained single-file interactive dashboard (`src/web_export.py`) with filterable/sortable repo table and embedded tech radar SVG. No server required; opens directly in a browser.

---

## Caching

### GitHub API Response Cache

`src/cache.py::ResponseCache` caches all GitHub REST API GET responses to `output/.cache/` as JSON files keyed by URL. Cache entries expire after 1 hour. This prevents redundant API calls during incremental re-audits and avoids rate limit exhaustion on large portfolios (100+ repos, each requiring 3-5 API calls).

The cache is bypassed automatically for endpoints that return 202 (GitHub is still computing stats) — these are retried with exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s) before falling back to a zero score.

### Clone Workspace Lifecycle

Repos are shallow-cloned (`git clone --depth 1`) to a temporary directory under `/tmp/audit-repos/` (or `$TMPDIR/audit-repos/`). Each repo is cloned to its own subdirectory named `{username}_{repo_name}`. After all analyzers have run against a repo the clone is immediately removed. The temp directory is cleaned up on process exit even if the audit fails, via a `try/finally` block in `cloner.py`.

## Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| GitHub API client | Raw `requests` calls | Avoids PyGithub/ghapi dependency; REST v3 is stable and sufficient |
| Clone strategy | `--depth 1` (shallow) | Only current file state matters; full history would be ~10x slower |
| Commit history | GitHub API stats endpoints | Faster than parsing local git log; contributor + frequency data in one call |
| Error isolation | Per-analyzer try/except | A malformed repo should never abort the full 100-repo portfolio run |
| Output primary format | JSON | Machine-readable; feeds PCC import, Notion sync, and Excel generation |
| Credentials | Environment variables only | Never passed as CLI args; never logged |
| External dependencies | Minimal (`requests`, `python-dateutil`, `openpyxl`, `radon`, `rich`, `anthropic`) | Keeps installation lightweight; no analysis frameworks |
